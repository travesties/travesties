# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Travis
I'm a software engineer with 8 years experience in the web development space, though I'm interested in a wide vareity of subjects.

My main area of focus is back-end/cloud development, with Golang and AWS being my preferred tools.

My most recent project is a web application for aggregating and organizing music from multiple streaming services into individual playlists to serve my music needs
as the GM of my TTRPG group. You can find this project at https://tttracks.app

Note: tttracks is in its alpha stage, so user registration requires a key. If you're interested in taking a look, contact me!
